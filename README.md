# Node.js Practice Repository

## Purpose
This repository is created purely for Node.js practice. I am currently learning Node.js and experimenting with small projects and exercises.

## Goals
1. Improve my Node.js skills.  
2. Practice using GitHub effectively by creating pull requests, reviewing them, and merging them myself.  
3. Keep updating this repository with the latest work and experiments as I progress.  

## Current Contents

- `Index.js` → Utility functions: `findMin` and `findDifference`.  
- `package.json` → Project metadata and setup.  
- `Test.js` → Basic tests.  
- `examples/strings.js` → String manipulation examples (indexOf, charAt, replace, trim, split, slice, template literals, custom functions).  

> **Note:** This project contains Node.js scripts and examples for practice. It will be updated continuously with new experiments.
