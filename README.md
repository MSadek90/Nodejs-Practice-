# Node.js Practice Repository

## Purpose
This repository is created purely for Node.js practice. I am currently learning Node.js and experimenting with small projects and exercises.

## Goals
1. Improve my Node.js skills.  
2. Practice using GitHub effectively by creating pull requests, reviewing them, and merging them myself.  
3. Keep updating this repository with the latest work and experiments as I progress.  

## Current Contents
- `Index.js` → Utility functions: `findMin` and `findDifference`.  
- `package.json` → Project metadata and setup.  
- Test scripts → Basic tests to verify the functions work correctly.  
## Note: Currently, this project contains basic Node.js scripts for practice purposes. It will be continuously updated with new experiments and code improvements
